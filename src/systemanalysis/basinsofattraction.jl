    basins(sys::StochSystem, A, B, C, H; kwargs...)
Computes the basins of attraction of StochSystem `sys` on a plane spanned by the distinct points `A`, `B`, `C` and limited by the box `H`. Uses the [`AttractorsViaProximity`](https://juliadynamics.github.io/Attractors.jl/v1.2/attractors/#Attractors.AttractorsViaProximity) function from [`DynamicalSystems.jl`](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DynamicalSystems.jl/stable/) to compute the basins of attraction.

`A`, `B`, `C` are elements of ``\\mathbb{R}^d`` (where ``d`` is the dimension of the  `sys`) and `H` is a hyperrectangle in ``\\mathbb{R}^d``.

The plane is given by ``P_{U,V} := \\{A+u(B-A)+v(C-A)\\in\\mathbb{R}^d: u \\in U,\\, v\\in V\\}`` for some closed and bounded real intervals ``U`` and ``V`` which are selected such that both
* ``P_{U,\\,V} \\subseteq H``, and
* ``U\\times V\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^2`` has maximal area,
i.e. ``P_{U,\\,V}`` is the "largest" possible plane contained within H. This plane is determined behind the scenes.

This function returns a four-dimensional vector. The first two entries are discretised versions of the interval ``U`` and ``V`` (as defined above, of lengths ``\\ell_U,\\,\\ell_V`` respectively); the third entry is a dictionary of the attractors (stable equilibria) of the system within `H`, and the final entry is an ``\\ell_V\\times\\ell_U`` matrix of integers that group the initial conditions (written in terms of ``A+u(B-A)+v(C-A)`` where ``u\\in U`` and ``v\\in V``) by which attractor they will in time converge to.

## Keyword arguments
* `bstep = [0.01, 0.01]`: a vector of length two whose elements respectively specify the length of the incremental steps taken across each dimension in the discretisation of your plane
* `pstep = [0.1, 0.1]`: a vector of length two whose elements give the increments of the mesh that the maximisation process of finding a plane from a box is taken over (for more information see the source code of the function `plane` in the `src/systemanalysis/planeofbox.jl` file)
* `ϵ_mapper = 0.01`: `ϵ` parameter of [`AttractorsViaProximity`](https://juliadynamics.github.io/Attractors.jl/v1.2/attractors/#Attractors.AttractorsViaProximity)
* `kwargs...`: keyword arguments passed to the [`AttractorsViaProximity`](https://juliadynamics.github.io/Attractors.jl/v1.2/attractors/#Attractors.AttractorsViaProximity) function (namely, `Ttr, Δt, horizon_limit, mx_chk_lost`)
